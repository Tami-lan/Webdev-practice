        <h3>NodeJs:</h3>
        <p>Node. js is single-threaded, we use it primarily for non-blocking, event-driven servers. We can also use Node. js for traditional websites and back-end API services, as it was designed with real-time, push-based architectures in mind.</p>
        
        <h3>Angular:</h3>
        <p>Angular is a client-side JavaScript framework that is used for creating dynamic and interactive web applications. This means that Angular is primarily used for frontend development, as it runs in the user's browser and is responsible for handling the presentation layer of a web application</p>
       
        <h3>ExpressJs:</h3>
        <p>Express. js offers a robust set of features that enhance your productivity and streamline your web application. It makes it easier to organize your application's functionality with middleware and routing. It adds helpful utilities to Node HTTP objects and facilitates the rendering of dynamic HTTP objects.</p>
        
        <h3>MongoDb:</h3>
        <p>MongoDB is an open-source document-oriented database that is designed to store a large scale of data and also allows you to work with that data very efficiently. It is categorized under the NoSQL (Not only SQL) database because the storage and retrieval of data in the MongoDB are not in the form of tables. </p>
